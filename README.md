# truck Game
### Physics based game made with Raylib

## About the game

Truck Game is a small game which includes a simple physics system made by us with the help of the Raylib Library. Along a collision system we also made a Pendulum effect , which sadly we had to cut it from the final version of the game because it made the game non-functional. However, theres a link for a .gif to go and watch the Pendulum effect of a Wrecking ball from a top-down view (see the Links for Downloads Title).

## How to play the game

Because its a prototype, we only focused on the gameplay aspect of the game. We leave many things behind such as a credits section,controls and many other customizable options.
For this reason, we will provide a useful bunch of information to clarify what do to and how to do the things you need to do in the game.

### Objective

You are a dump truck, your objective is to pickup the garbage bags and leave it on the blue dumpster with the REVERSE button. Be mindful that you have to complete the objective within 60 seconds and you can only crash a certain amount of times.

### Controls

- Up Arrow: Move Up

- Down Arrow: Move Down

- Left Arrow: Move Left

- Right Arrow: Move Right

- Spacebar: Reverse

### Tips

- Since its a physics game, take on mind that you need to complete the objective by using the physics involved in the game. You wont leave the garbages bags in the dumpster by crashing with the front of your truck, you will need to use the REVERSE button and leave the physics do the work for you!
